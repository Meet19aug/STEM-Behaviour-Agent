# Agent-Based Modeling of Gender Disparity in STEM Fields

## Description

This project explores the persistent under-representation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields through the use of an agent-based modeling approach. Despite increased educational opportunities and targeted initiatives, significant gender disparities remain. Our agent-based model simulates the decision-making processes of individuals regarding STEM career paths, focusing on the interplay between personal attributes and social influences.

## Key Features

- **Agent-Based Model**: Simulates individual decision-making processes influenced by personal traits, social interactions, and media portrayals.
- **Focus on Personal Attributes**: Includes the Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) to determine career paths.
- **Social Dynamics**: Models social interactions and networks to understand peer influence on career decisions.
- **Media Influence**: Examines the impact of media representation on career aspirations in STEM fields.
- **Educational Interventions**: Investigates the effect of targeted educational strategies on increasing women's participation in STEM.

## Research Motivation

Addressing the STEM gender gap is crucial for leveraging a broader range of talents and perspectives necessary for technological and scientific advancements. Enhanced participation of women in STEM can lead to more inclusive solutions and innovations.
